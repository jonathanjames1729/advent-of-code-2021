Starting velocity: v=(u, w)

Horizontally
------------
Takes u steps to reduce u to zero
Travels u(u + 1) / 2 in total horizontally
If u = 12 then the probe travels to 78 in 12 steps

Vertically
----------
Takes w steps to reduce w to zero (the high point)
Stays at the high point for 1 step
The high point is w(w + 1) / 2
After w more steps is at zero elavation travelling at -(w + 1)
Depths that the probe reaches are -(2w + i + 1)i / 2 for i=1, 2, 3,...
In particular if w + 1 > 159 then the probe never hits the target

So v=(12, 158) hits the target and hits the highest point of all such trajectories
The highest point is 12,561
